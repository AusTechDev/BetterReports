# BetterReports
A lightweight plugin for Minecraft that utilizes Discord webhooks for player and bug reports!

# About
BetterReports was coded at first as a small project for a Minecraft server. I then thought
that I should submit it as an open source resource on Spigot where we can continue to develop
the plugin.

### Key features
* Lightweight and simple
* Discord webhook
* Works on any version from 1.8 to 1.16.x
* Great for neatly archiving reports in a Discord channel

Feel free to contribute to the project with improvements and/or new features as well as by
creating issues for bugs/errors so that we can work on fixing them :)
